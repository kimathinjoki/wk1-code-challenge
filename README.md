Week1 code challenge.

# DESCRIPTION

1. Student Grade Generator
Prompts the user to input student marks.
The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade:
A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40
Found in file netSalaryCalculator.js


2. Speed-Detector code

A program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it prints “Ok”.
Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70) it gives the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.
For example, if the speed is 80, it prints: “Points: 2”.
If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function prints: “License suspended”.


3. Net-Salary Calculator code

A program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits.
Calculates the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary
The program takes in twp parameter: the basic salary and their total benefits.

# PROJECT SETUP
 The netsalaryCalculator.js when run  using node asks for your basic salary and your total benefits and returns your Gross Salary, Net salary, PAYE and NHIF and NSSF contributions

 The Speed-detector.js asks for a speed input and when called in the terminal using node it ouputs whether the speed is fine and for every 5km past 70 it returns pointspoints.

 The studentGradeGenerator.js asks for an input of a student's score and returns a grade.
